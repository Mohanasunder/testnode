# aplx-hmw-server
Always set web config before creating the server

Can create server instance by calling
```
new ApiServer().start(port, env, [controllers], isAuthorizationRequired)
```

### Notes
> Dont add authentication routes to your process, By default if the source is Aplx, it will be added


## Factory 
> All configurations like username, password, db connection etc will be passed from Client project. So that we utilize this factory function to read it. 
> In client project, import factory function and send the data.
 We will use factory for access data across controllers. 
        
### How to access factory
factory will have 4 methods
- setWebConfig() -> include all required keys which needs from client configuration.
- getWebConfig() ->  We will get the configuration based on the key.
- syncConfig(data, key) -> to store any other values which may be accessed across the classes
- getConfig(key) -> get the data based on key which is stored with syncConfig().
